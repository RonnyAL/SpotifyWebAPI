# Spotify Web API

This is a plugin for [EventGhost](http://eventghost.net) - *an advanced, easy to use and extensible automation tool for MS Windows.* The plugin utilizes the Spotify Web API to (eventually) allow automation of any of [Spotify's API endpoints](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) (there are many).

## How it started

Originally, this was a personal project designed to allow a shortcut for adding the currently playing song to a specific playlist. After some help and feedback on the [EventGhost forums](http://eventghost.net/forum/), I finished the (then) Python script that made my wish possible. I was then offered help writing a more extensive plugin, and thought it was a good idea.

## Contributing

GitHub is all about collaboration, and I am more than happy to receive pull requests. If you feel like you can contribute, feel free to give it a shot.

## More to come

This text is very temporary, and I expect it to be updated as soon as the plugin is more polished.
